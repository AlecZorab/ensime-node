# Ensime client Node.js bindings

This is a collection of utilities for working with Ensime from a node environment. Previously part of ensime-atom but broken out for reusability in for instance a planned ensime-vscode package.

## Work in progress!!! 

This package needs lot of cleanup and test coverage. The pull-out from ensime-atom was made in a rush to see that this approach was feasable so there is definitely room for improvements :)
